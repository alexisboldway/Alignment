        <!-- Instructions for the Visual Exercise -->
        <p>
            This interactive tool is designed to help you assess the alignment between your current self and your ideal, vision-driven self. 
            By completing this exercise, youâ€™ll gain a clear, visual overview of where you're aligned and where you may need to focus your energy for improvement.

        <p>
            For each of the following categories, assign a score from 1 to 10  
            - 1 represents complete misalignment  
            - 10 represents full alignment** with your ideal self.
        </p>
